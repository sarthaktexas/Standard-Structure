## Minimal Template

```
┏━bin
┃ ┗━main.dart
┃
┣━lib
┃ ┗━basic.dart
┃
┗━test
  ┗━basic_test.dart
```

### `bin/`

`bin` really only holds `main.dart` which is the entry point to the program

### `lib/`

`lib` is where most of the code for a dart project goes.

### `test/`

`test` holds all the unit tests for the project.
