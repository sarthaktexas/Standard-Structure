# 🎯 [Dart](https://dart.dev)
## Minimal Template

```
├── bin/
│   └── main.dart
├── lib/
│   └── basic.dart
└── test/
    └── basic_test.dart
```

### `bin/`

`bin` really only holds `main.dart` which is the entry point to the program

### `lib/`

`lib` is where most of the code for a dart project goes.

### `test/`

`test` holds all the unit tests for the project.
